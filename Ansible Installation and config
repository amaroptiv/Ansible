Install ansible in Control Node, As am using Amazon Linux2 OS, Amazon-linux-extras will install all required dependencies.

Usually the Master node should be "2x" larger than the worker/control nodes

Perform the below commands on the Master Engine
-------------------------------------------------

amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y

verify ansible version by running below command
ansible --version
which ansible
ansible-config dump

Create a common user for all ansible activities

Creating a user, Here am using "ansibleusr" user and set password.

useradd ansibleusr
passwd ansibleusr

Provide Sudeoer permissions
visudo

Add below entry to sudeor file.

ansibleusr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

login with the ansibleusr

su - ansibleusr

Enable SSH Connection across the instances.

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Set "PasswordAuthentication yes"
service sshd restart

Control Nodes
=============

Connect to all the nodes and Create common user same as Above.

useradd ansibleusr
passwd ansibleusr
visudo
ansibleusr ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
su - ansibleusr
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Set "PasswordAuthentication yes"
service sshd restart

Configure password-less authentication.

Perform this on all the above Control Nodes

Create an SSH Public key and Private Key in Server and Copy Public Key to across the instances. Make sure you are doing this as ansibleusr, and perform this from Control Node.

Perform the below commands on Master
-----------------------------------

ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id ansibleuser@Managed-node-1/2/3

Now test the Password-less authentication. It should not prompt any password.
ssh Node-ip

Yeeee! you have configured Ansible. Happy Learning!
